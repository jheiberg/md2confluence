# [TASK001] - Test Confluence Import

**Status:** Pending  
**Added:** 2025-10-29  
**Updated:** 2025-10-29

## Original Request
Need to verify that the generated Confluence Storage Format XML and draw.io diagrams work correctly when imported into an actual Confluence instance.

## Thought Process
The application has been completely rewritten to generate Confluence Storage Format (XHTML) with embedded draw.io diagrams. However, this has not been tested with a real Confluence instance. Testing is critical because:

1. **Format Validation**: Confluence may have specific requirements for Storage Format that aren't documented
2. **Draw.io Integration**: Need to verify draw.io diagrams render and are editable
3. **Code Block Styling**: Confirm midnight theme applies correctly
4. **Edge Cases**: Find any issues with specific markdown patterns

The testing should cover:
- Simple markdown with one diagram
- Complex markdown with multiple diagrams
- Various Mermaid diagram types (flowchart, sequence, class, etc.)
- Code blocks in different languages
- Tables, lists, and other markdown features

## Implementation Plan
1. Set up test Confluence instance or get access to one
2. Create test markdown files with various features
3. Process files through the application
4. Import generated XML into Confluence
5. Verify all content displays correctly
6. Test draw.io diagram editability
7. Document any issues found
8. Fix issues and retest
