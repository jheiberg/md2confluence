# [TASK003] - Create Confluence Import Guide

**Status:** Pending  
**Added:** 2025-10-29  
**Updated:** 2025-10-29

## Original Request
User mentioned wanting a guide on how to import the generated files into Confluence. This was promised during earlier conversation but not yet delivered.

## Thought Process
Users will need clear instructions on how to actually use the generated files in Confluence. The process isn't immediately obvious, especially for users who haven't worked with Confluence Storage Format before.

The guide should cover:
1. **What files are generated** and what each one is for
2. **How to import the XML** into Confluence
3. **How to verify** the import worked correctly
4. **How to edit draw.io diagrams** after import
5. **Troubleshooting** common issues
6. **Best practices** for using the tool

This guide will be valuable because:
- Reduces support questions
- Helps users succeed on first try
- Documents expected behavior
- Provides troubleshooting reference

Format options:
- New markdown file: CONFLUENCE_IMPORT_GUIDE.md
- Add section to README.md
- Create separate IMPORTING.md file

Preferred: Separate file for focused reference.

## Implementation Plan
1. Research Confluence import methods (if not already known)
2. Document step-by-step import process with screenshots/descriptions
3. Explain what each generated file does
4. Show how to edit draw.io diagrams post-import
5. Add troubleshooting section for common issues
6. Include tips and best practices
7. Review and test instructions
8. Link from README.md and QUICK_START.md
