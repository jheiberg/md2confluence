# [TASK002] - Update Documentation

**Status:** Pending  
**Added:** 2025-10-29  
**Updated:** 2025-10-29

## Original Request
Documentation files currently reference the PNG approach, but the application now uses draw.io + Confluence Storage Format. Need to update all documentation to match current implementation.

## Thought Process
The project went through several iterations:
1. SVG approach (abandoned - Confluence security issues)
2. PNG approach (abandoned - not editable, quality issues)
3. Draw.io + Confluence Storage Format (current)

The documentation was written during the PNG phase and needs comprehensive updates to reflect the current architecture. This is important because:
- Users reading README will get incorrect information
- Setup instructions reference wrong file types
- Technical explanations don't match code
- WHY_PNG.md is now obsolete

Files requiring updates:
- **README.md**: Main project documentation
- **QUICK_START.md**: User guide with step-by-step instructions
- **PROJECT_SUMMARY.md**: Technical overview
- **VISUAL_GUIDE.md**: Visual walkthrough (may need new screenshots)
- **WHY_PNG.md**: Either delete or replace with WHY_DRAWIO.md

## Implementation Plan
1. Review each documentation file
2. Identify all PNG-specific references
3. Update with draw.io + Confluence Storage Format information
4. Update file type references (.png â†’ .drawio, .xml)
5. Update workflow descriptions
6. Update feature descriptions
7. Verify examples are current
8. Check all links still work
