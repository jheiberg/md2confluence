# Active Context

## Current Focus
Project initialization and memory bank creation. Core application functionality is complete and working.

## Recent Changes (October 29, 2025)

### Code Fixes
1. **Fixed file loading issue** (most recent)
   - Found corrupt code in `app.js` from previous edit
   - `displayFiles()` function was duplicated and malformed
   - `copyForConfluence()` had mixed legacy code
   - Fixed duplicate function declarations
   - Application now loads and functions correctly

2. **Repository Setup**
   - Initialized Git repository
   - Created `.gitignore` file
   - Committed all project files
   - Created GitHub repository: https://github.com/jheiberg/md2confluence
   - Pushed code to remote (switched from SSH to HTTPS due to timeout)

3. **Complete Rewrite to Confluence Storage Format** (earlier today)
   - Replaced entire PNG generation approach
   - Implemented draw.io XML generation via `mermaidToDrawio()`
   - Implemented Confluence XHTML generation via `markdownToConfluenceStorage()`
   - Added inline markdown conversion via `convertInlineMarkdown()`
   - Updated file type icons (drawio: üìä, confluence: üìÑ)
   - Changed copy function to copy Confluence XML instead of HTML

## Current State

### What's Working
‚úÖ Application loads in browser  
‚úÖ File selection and upload  
‚úÖ Mermaid diagram extraction  
‚úÖ Draw.io XML generation  
‚úÖ Confluence Storage Format generation  
‚úÖ SVG preview rendering  
‚úÖ File download functionality  
‚úÖ Clipboard copy  
‚úÖ Code block styling (midnight theme)  
‚úÖ Git repository initialized and pushed  

### What Needs Testing
‚ö†Ô∏è Actual Confluence import (not tested with real Confluence instance)  
‚ö†Ô∏è Draw.io diagram editability in Confluence  
‚ö†Ô∏è Complex markdown edge cases  
‚ö†Ô∏è Large files with many diagrams  

### Known Issues
- Documentation files (README, QUICK_START, etc.) still reference PNG approach
- Need to update docs to reflect draw.io + Confluence Storage Format approach
- `WHY_PNG.md` is now obsolete with current approach

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities
1. **Test with Confluence**: Verify XML import works correctly
2. **Update Documentation**: 
   - Revise README.md
   - Update QUICK_START.md
   - Update PROJECT_SUMMARY.md
   - Update VISUAL_GUIDE.md
   - Remove or revise WHY_PNG.md

3. **Create Import Guide**: Promised but not yet delivered
   - How to import XML into Confluence
   - How to verify draw.io diagrams work
   - Troubleshooting common issues

### Code Quality
- Address lint warnings (non-critical):
  - Cognitive complexity in `markdownToConfluenceStorage()` (60 vs threshold 15)
  - Use `replaceAll()` instead of `replace()` with global flag (already done in `escapeXml()`)
  - Unused variable `listLevel`
  - Replace `window` with `globalThis`

### Future Enhancements
- Batch file processing
- Custom theme options for code blocks
- Direct Confluence API integration
- Support for other diagram formats
- Drag-and-drop file upload

## Active Decisions

### Recent Architecture Decisions
1. **Use Confluence Storage Format** instead of HTML
   - Rationale: Native Confluence format, better compatibility
   - Impact: Full rewrite of conversion logic
   - Result: More maintainable, better integration

2. **Use draw.io XML** instead of PNG
   - Rationale: Editable diagrams, native Confluence support
   - Impact: Changed diagram generation completely
   - Result: Professional solution with editability

3. **Keep SVG for preview** in browser
   - Rationale: Fast, high quality, already working
   - Impact: Two rendering paths (SVG preview, draw.io export)
   - Result: Best user experience

### Technical Preferences
- Client-side only (no server)
- CDN for dependencies (no npm/build)
- Pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- Inline styles for preview (matches Confluence)
- Git for version control
- GitHub for repository hosting

## Context for Next Session

### What You Need to Know
1. **Core functionality is complete** - application converts markdown to Confluence format with draw.io diagrams
2. **Not tested with real Confluence** - need user feedback on actual import
3. **Documentation is outdated** - references old PNG approach
4. **Repository is live** - https://github.com/jheiberg/md2confluence
5. **Memory bank just created** - this is the first complete documentation set

### Key Files to Check
- `app.js` - Main application logic (just fixed)
- `index.html` - UI structure
- `styles.css` - Styling
- Documentation files - need updates

### User Expectations
User has been working through multiple iterations:
- Started with basic HTML preview
- Tried SVG (didn't work in Confluence)
- Tried PNG (worked but had issues)
- Now using draw.io + Confluence Storage Format

User is technical and understands the trade-offs. Likely next questions:
- Does this actually work in Confluence?
- How do I import the files?
- Can I customize the styling?

## Important Patterns

### Conversation Style
User communicates concisely, expects:
- Direct answers
- Technical accuracy
- Working code
- Clear explanations of trade-offs

### Work Style
- Iterative improvement
- Willing to try different approaches
- Values native integration over workarounds
- Prefers working solutions over perfect code

### Project Evolution
This project has gone through significant iterations based on real-world testing. Be prepared for further changes based on Confluence import testing results.
